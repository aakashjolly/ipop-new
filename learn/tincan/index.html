<p>The TinCan link is the core communication abstraction used by IPOP to create tunnels. The name comes from an analogy with tin can phones &#8211; a popular children&#8217;s toy where two cans are connected by a string, creating an ad-hoc link for communication between two friends.</p>
<p>In IPOP, TinCan links areÂ bi-directional communication channels that connect user devices end-to-end to other trusted user devices, where trust is derived from an online social network (OSN) service. Instead of carrying voice like a tin can phone, IPOP TinCan links carry tunneled IP packets (IPv4 or IPv6) &#8211; and since version 15.01, also Ethernet frames in IPOP&#8217;s &#8220;switch mode&#8221;. Packets are intercepted by virtual network interfaces (tap) and then tunneled by IPOP through TinCan links; at the destination, they are injected again into a virtual network interface. This allows existing applications to work unmodified when running over an IPOP virtual network, as depicted in the figure.</p>
<p>IPOP&#8217;s implementation of TinCan links leverages extensively the <a href="https://developers.google.com/talk/libjingle/" target="_blank">libjingle</a> open-source code, which is widely used and can run on a variety of platforms. The IPOP-TinCan module in the source code is primarily responsible for the creation, management, and tear-down of individual TinCan links with peers. This is done under coordination of IPOP&#8217;s <a title="Controller" href="../controllers">controller</a> module; controller and TinCan are decoupled modules that communicate through an API layered upon local host sockets, allowing flexibility in the design and facilitating the development of new IPOP-based VPNs.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a title="GroupVPN" href="../groupvpn">GroupVPN</a> controller is based on group memberships; it creates TinCan links to any online node that belongs to the group, and establishes a flat virtual IP address subnet for nodes in the group, with the purpose of creating virtual private clusters. A different controller for a different purpose &#8211; the <a title="SocialVPN" href="../socialvpn">SocialVPN</a> &#8211; uses the same underlying primitives, but creates TinCan links to devices of the local user&#8217;s individual friends, and implements dynamic address assignment and translation to allow it to scale to large social networks.</p>
